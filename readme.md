# the shapening

Code to the first experiment of my diploma thesis.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
## CONTENT
* octave script 
* the [instruction](./instruction/) displayed before the experiment block
* the [rating](./rating/) that I only put on screen for the practice trail
* the used [stimuli](./stimulus/)
* the used [practice stimuli](./stimulusP/)
* [example output](./results/) TODO
* [R files](./results/) to make a prety data frame  TODO
* the possible [startupscreen](./startup/) where you can put youre logo
* and some [stuff](./stuff/) I used when creating the experiment

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
## WHAT DOES THIS THING DO ?

 The script is presenting the stimulus [/stimulus](./stimulus/) eihter in a central or one of the four corners of the screen. This is to invoke different reaction times because the stimulus is processed either in foveal or onvoveal vision. Also I hope to get some insight to the way persons percieve different cinds of shapes and some directional tendencies.
